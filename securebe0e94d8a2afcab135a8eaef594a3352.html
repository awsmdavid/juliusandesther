                    <p>Our story is one of redemption.  In the early days as UVA first-years, we AIM-ed nonsense and laughed about silly little things (mostly laughing AT each other).  Somewhere along the road, we became friends, and that friendship became a solid foundation for our relationship.  Finally, just before graduation, we knew (admitted) it was more.  Dating your close friend was loads of fun – from visiting all the best places to eat in Georgetown to watching movies and eating gelato at Reston Town Center.  
                    </p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>We were determined to learn how to grow and share life together.  This became more challenging with four years of long distance and several road bumps in our relationship.  And yet despite our struggle to be our ideal selves, God met us at all our shortcomings.  We find great joy every time we reflect on our journey and see that God keeps blessing us, redeeming our missteps, and sending us off on a precious path together – now as (almost) husband and wife.</p>

                            <p>I always wondered what kind of man God put on this planet to be with me.  I prayed he would be a leader – bold and courageous – and that I would respect him for his strong character.  I also shamelessly hoped he would be tall, athletic, and funny!  I’m always blown away by how God answers my prayers, and then some.</p>
                            <br />
                            <p>When we met, Julius had a memorable name, but he would not talk to me.  And so I spent the next few years convincing him to be my friend by letting him pick on me.  It’s wonderful how this dynamic blossomed into our relationship because I love his company.  He is the best kind of friend – one who is fiercely loyal and challenges you with growth.  But he is also the sweetest kind of boyfriend – one who earnestly learned how to take care of me in customized ways (like replacing “look tired” in his vocabulary with “seem tired” because I’m so nitpicky about word choice).  Julius keeps me grounded beyond what I knew to need, and he was patient enough to let me learn how to need.  I am so thankful and excited to spend a lifetime together with my handsome best friend. </p>

                            <p>Esther and I first met at UVA during our fellowship's lock-in when we had to act out a skit. While I was practicing my peacock dance, she looked at me and asked, "Is that what you are really going to do?". I guess this is when she thought "who is this joofus?" and that is how our relationship began. Over the years, we grew to be good friends and admittedly I had a big crush on her. </p>  
                            <br />
                            <p>It is amazing how easily I can share my thoughts with Esther. I thank God everyday for sending Esther into my life. I adore her company and I appreciate her wanting to know my thoughts, opinions and words. Her faith and love for God has always been an encouragement in our relationship. I can't thank God enough for sending such a fun, loving, encouraging, caring, and supportive wife-to-be to someone like me. I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with the person I love the most. </p>
