        			<p>Our story is one of redemption.  In the early days as UVA first-years, we AIM-ed nonsense and laughed about silly little things (mostly laughing AT each other).  Somewhere along the road, we became friends, and that friendship became a solid foundation for our relationship.  Finally, just before graduation, we knew (admitted) it was more.  Dating your close friend was loads of fun – from visiting all the best places to eat in Georgetown to watching movies and eating gelato at Reston Town Center. 
                    </p>
        			<br/>
    				<p>We were determined to learn how to grow and share life together.  This became more challenging with four years of long distance and several road bumps in our relationship.  And yet despite our struggle to be our ideal selves, God met us at all our shortcomings.  We find great joy every time we reflect on our journey and see that God keeps blessing us, redeeming our missteps, and sending us off on a precious path together – now as (almost) husband and wife.</p>

                        Julius fought an uphill battle asking for my parents’ permission to marry me.They were just as eager to give their permission – too eager.  Julius asked my mom if he could meet with them, assuming she understood his intent.  She did not.  In fact, she asked me whether I would be joining them.  Frazzled after I interrogated him, Julius told my mom he would reschedule.  He tried again soon – this time calling my parents when he knew they were out on errands without me.  Yet, as soon as my dad saw me, he announced, “Julius is coming over next Tuesday at 1:00!”  And, Tuesday never happened because the government shut down (I was working at Congress at the time and stayed home).Finally, Julius resorted to visiting my parents at Morning Prayer (6:00am).  And he succeeded!  Poor guy.

                        Julius told me his uncle was coming to town.  He said his mom had suggested I come meet his relatives for lunch in Georgetown.  Ordinarily, Georgetown would raise a red flag, but Julius’s mom loves crepes so his story seemed to check out.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        The entire week, Julius had been “really busy at work.”  The day before (Thursday), I told Julius I had a lot of work to finish over the weekend, and he responded, “stay late tonight and finish it.”  To my knowledge, we only had lunch plans so I couldn’t understand why he was being so bossy.  Then, the morning of, my mom told me I had to “look pretty” because it was a “special day.”  Irritated that she was going to get my hopes up and disappoint me, I refused to get suspicious.

                        Julius suggested we meet at Caribou Coffee to drive together to Georgetown.  I was still noticeably irritated.  Julius had torn a seam in his pants (in an inconvenient location) earlier in the day, and he reported he did that just to make me laugh.  It worked, and he cheered me up as always.  While driving to Georgetown, Julius also said, “Don’t be surprised if my uncle tries to give you legal work.  My dad told him you passed the bar.”  Alarmed, I pleaded, “YOU HAVE TO tell him ‘no.’ If I tell him ‘no,’ he’ll think I’m rude.This is my first time meeting him, you have to tell him for me.”  This worry heavily distracted me from any suspicion.

                        We arrived in Georgetown, and Julius’s relatives “were running 30 minutes late.”  So Julius suggested we get some coffee (funny coming from a guy who was just at Caribou).  I obliged and we walked down the street until I finally said, “Hey! This is our gelato place!” (Still no suspicion. Dense, I know.)  Julius said he would order espresso and said, “Didn’t you have to go to the bathroom?”  I responded, “Oh yea!  BRB!”  (This is a frequent conversation in our dating history.)  When I came back from the bathroom, Julius was gone.  Confused, I asked the employee:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Me: Um, do you know where that guy went?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Dolcezza Employee: He said he forgot his wallet.  Are you Esther Kim?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Me: (freaked out) Yes…
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        DE: I was told to give you this. (hands over a cup of gelato with a yellow heart on a stick)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        I recognized Julius’s handwriting immediately, and began my search for yellow dots.

                        The yellow dots each had cute messages (e.g. “Hi Girlfriend!”), and each one made me smile.  Four years earlier, outside the gelato shop on the steps of the neighboring church, Julius had read me a letter asking me to be his girlfriend.  His yellow dots retold this story and asked me to come inside the church.  When I stepped inside the sanctuary, I saw a candlelit path of roses and photos.  I paused sheepishly, uncertain what I was supposed to do next.  Right on cue, Julius came out from behind me.

                        <p>
                        Julius asked me to grab a book for him from the pews.  It was titled “Julius & Esther,” and he wanted to read it to me.  Early in our dating period, I had given Julius a children’s book called “I Like You” because it reminded me of us.  For example, the book reads, “If I am a goofus on the roofus hollering my head off, you are one too.”  I used to call Julius “Joofus” in college (Julius + Doofus) and was amused by this similarity, among others. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Julius had rewritten this children’s book, substituting “Joofus” for “goofus,” and “I love you” for “I like you.”  Now when a girl waits 4 years to hear those words, they’re special.  He even handwrote the text and pasted photos from the past 8 years that we knew each other.  Julius was nearing the end of his book, where he repeated those words to me several times.  As they sank in, I couldn’t help but to cry (tears of joy!).

                        Finally, Julius arrived at the last page.  He got down on one knee, said more sweet things that we both can hardly remember, and asked me to marry him.  To me, it was the perfect proposal.  Absolutely perfect.
