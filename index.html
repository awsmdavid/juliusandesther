    			<p><b>619 10th Street NW, Washington, DC</b></p>
    			<p>The church where the wedding ceremony will take place on April 6th is St. Patrick's Church, where you'll find us most Sunday mornings.  It's the oldest parish in the Federal City of Washington, D.C, established in 1794 to minister to the needs of the stonemasons building the White House and the U.S. Capitol. The first American to be ordained a priest in the United States, Fr. William Matthews, was named pastor in 1804. In addition to its beauty and amazing history, there is a wonderful choir and even more wonderful Pastor &mdash; Monsignor Sal, who will be marrying us.</p>

    			<p><b>1127 Connecticut Avenue NW, Washington, DC</b></p>
    			<p>We fell in love with the ballroom inside this historic hotel for its grandeur and timeless elegance. Upon opening in 1925, it was said to have more gold leaf than any other US building except the Library of Congress, and has earned a place on the list of the National Register of Historic Places.  Both glamorous and historical &mdash; nice!</p>
				<br/>
				<p>Ok, some more reasons it's cool... it was designed by Warren and Westmore, the New York architects who also worked on Manhattan's Grand Central Station. The hotel is centrally located in the heart of DC's bustling Dupont Circle neighborhood, near lots of great shops, restaurants, and attractions. It's also four blocks from the White House and only a few metro stops away from all the monuments and museums, making it a great base for sightseeing.</p>
				<br/>
				<p>We can't wait to party the night away with you!</p>

                <p>First things first &mdash; how to get to the church! It's at 10th and G, Northwest.</p> 
                <br />
                <p><b>From the Mayflower</b>, we plan on having a shuttle to take you from the hotel to the church and back.</p> 
                <br />
                <p><b>From Arlington or DC</b>, the easiest way is to get a cab and tell the cabbie to take you to the church at 10th and G Northwest. Another option is to take the Metro Red Line to Metro Center and walk a block.</p>
                <br />
                <p><b>For those driving</b>, the address is <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=619+10th+Street+Northwest,+Washington,+DC&hl=en&ll=38.898164,-77.025597&spn=0.009569,0.018218&sll=38.898113,-77.025965&sspn=0.001204,0.002277&gl=us&hnear=619+10th+St+NW,+Washington,+District+of+Columbia+20004&t=m&z=16" target="_blank">619 10th Street NW, Washington, DC</a>.  We plan to have the garage next to the church on 10th street open that day. If you show your wedding invitation you'll be able to park for free in that garage.</p>

				<p>For out of town guests, we've got a couple of hotel options.  The first is the The Mayflower, where the reception will be held. It's an awesome spot to be in the city and we highly recommend it.  Until March 8th, they are holding a limited number of rooms for us at $189(+tax) per night.  There is a conference in the city that is increasing demand for rooms on the weekend of our wedding, so we recommend grabbing a room early. The address for the Mayflower is <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=+1127+Connecticut+Avenue+Northwest,+Washington,+DC+&hl=en&ll=38.90496,-77.040124&spn=0.009568,0.018218&sll=38.909202,-77.040167&sspn=0.019135,0.036435&gl=us&hnear=1127+Connecticut+Ave+NW,+Washington,+District+of+Columbia+20036&t=m&z=16&iwloc=A" target="_blank">1127 Connecticut Avenue NW, Washington, DC</a></p>
				<br />
				<p>For the discounted rate, please reserve through <a href="https://resweb.passkey.com/Resweb.do?mode=welcome_ei_new&eventID=10220216" target="_blank">this special link</a>.</p>
				<br />
				<img src="http://static.ashleyjeremy.com/arlington_courthouse.png" alt="arlington_courthouse" width="303" height="28" />
				<p>We know that The Mayflower (and downtown DC in general) isn't cheap, so we've arranged for a lower rate at a hotel right across the river from DC in Arlington, VA.  The Arlington Courthouse suites are $119(+tax) per night and located a few blocks from the Courthouse metro stop in a nice area of Arlington, VA.  They also have two and three bedroom suites for $199 and $299. The church and the reception will be an easy cab ride away and all the sightseeing is metro accessible.  It's a great lower priced option located at <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=+1200+North+Courthouse+Road,+Arlington,+VA+&hl=en&ll=38.887726,-77.084155&spn=0.009971,0.018218&sll=38.889363,-77.084026&sspn=0.009971,0.018218&gl=us&hnear=1200+N+Courthouse+Rd,+Arlington,+Virginia+22201&t=m&z=16&iwloc=A" target="_blank">1200 North Courthouse Rd, Arlington, VA</a></p>
				<br />
				<p>For the discounted rate, you can call the hotel at 703.524.40000 extension 0, refer to the "Rephlo Wedding Block" and make sure you give your credit card number to guarantee your arrival. The $119 rate is available until March 22nd.</a></p>

					<p>My older sister, Heather, is very close to me and has been a major influence my entire life. I have always looked up to her and wouldn't be the same person I am today without her. She is one of the strongest, as well as one of the most loving, people I've been privileged to know.

					<p>Will is an awesome friend. We met in seventh grade and were immediately absolutely ridiculous. We made up words (Will's specialty), annoyed the teachers (in a nice way), and were basically normal thirteen year old boys.  Eventually, we grew up.  While we are still sometimes ridiculous, Will's been there for me in countless non-ridiculous ways.</p>

If we weren't riding, we were probably getting excited about some stereo equipment. He's a great guy to be around.

					<p><b>Kassi Absar</b></p>
					<p>Kassi and I met freshman year in art theory class. A deep friendship began when one day we partnered up on a class project and took the metro down to the art gallery, missed our stop because we couldn't stop talking to each other, and ended up going to the mall instead! Kassi is tons of fun, super smart, and an adventurous chick. We spent lots of time in college cooking and painting together. Unfortunately, Kassi won't be able to be in our wedding, since she is teaching in Bangledesh this year, but will certainly be there in spirit!</p>

    			<p>We went out and registered for a bunch of awesome things. Shopping for stuff! Playing with kitchen goodies! Bar code scanners! Feeling silky smooth sheets! It was a ton of fun.</p>
    			<br/>
    			<p>Everything we put on the registries are things we'll love and would spruce up the house quite a lot, but honestly, the most important gift you can bring us is having you and your dancing shoes at our celebration. We are pumped to spend our special day with you and feel very blessed to have you in our lives!</p>
